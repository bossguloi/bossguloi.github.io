## Part 1 - A Shopify Theme Primer

Shopify gives us the flexibility. 

---

## Part 2 - Tools and Workflow 

This part looks at how to address each of these limitations by setting up a local development environment that synchronizes your code changes to Shopify. It also looks at how to use a popular revision control system (Git) to properly version and manage changes to a theme, and finally looks at advanced build tools (Shopify’s Slate and others) that allow us to utilize more advanced web development techniques when dealing with themes.

---

## Part 3 Principles and Process

This part’ll be discussing a few principles while working on Shopify themes, as well as looking at the sorts of processes that theme developers use to help deliver successful projects.

---

## Part 4 Designing Theme Foundations

The focus will be on the fundamentals of building a Shopify theme more than the fundamentals of web or visual design. 

---

## Part 5 Designing Product Pages

Once we have a basic theme structure to work with, we can start to build out the individual pages on the store. This part starts with the most important one—the product page.

---

## Part 6 Designing Home and Collection Pages

With the all-important product page out of the way, we can now turn to some of the other important components of a Shopify theme. In this part, we’ll be looking at the design and implementation of a store’s home and collection pages.

---

## Part 7 Carts, Checkouts, and Content

In this part, we’ll be looking at how we can encourage customers to complete their journey from that point and make it through the checkout so that your merchant gets paid. 

---

## Part 8 Theme Settings and Going Global

Whatever the situation, end users of your Shopify theme are almost always going to require some level of theme customization. To avoid forcing merchants to run to a developer every time something needs to change on their stores, Shopify themes provide for per-store configuration via a couple of different features—theme settings and locales.
For themes developed on behalf of clients, using these features to add a certain level of DIY customizability will save you plenty of valuable time in “five-minute fix” customer support. For themes you’re selling to multiple clients, it’s absolutely essential that end users be able to modify a wide range of theme aspects so that they can “own” their theme and customize it in a way that matches their brand.

## Part 9 SEO and Social Sharing

Traffic is the lifeblood of any online store, and while it can vary greatly in quality, when it comes to quantity, bigger is usually better. The difficult part, of course, is getting that traffic in the first place.
Every day, Shopify storeowners experiment with hundreds of different marketing channels and tactics, trying to bring more paying customers to their sites. 
Instead, this part focuses on the specific things you can do as a Shopify theme developer to make sure that your themes offer the best possible starting point for merchants looking to market and grow their brands. This chapter covers a checklist of “on-page” best practices, discusses ways to provide search engines with structured information about a Shopify store, and finally looks at what we can do to promote the sharing of store content via social channels.

---

## Part 10 Performance

This part explains theme performance—why it’s important, how to measure it, and how to improve it. It discussed techniques that we can use to both reduce initial load times and improve the perceived responsiveness of a Shopify storefront.
While it pays dividends to be thinking about these ideas from day one of your theme design, the techniques discussed here are equally useful for existing themes that need some fat trimmed.

---

## Part 11 Collaborative Theme Development

This final part looks at some strategies and tools you can use to make it easier to build Shopify themes in collaboration with others. It will also discuss how you can deploy your themes in a professional manner to reduce the risk of downtime, conflicts, or errors on the theme being used by your customers.
Finally, I’ll wrap up the substantive part of this project by discussing how you can make the most of Shopify’s ecosystem to boost your understanding of the platform and forge deeper connections within the partner community.
